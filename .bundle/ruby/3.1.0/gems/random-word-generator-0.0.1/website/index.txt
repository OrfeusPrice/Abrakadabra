h1. Random Word Generator

h2. What

The Random Word Generator is a very simple library with a very limited usage.
Its primary purpose is to generate a random string based on English dictionary words.

Born from a ruby challenge, I figured that this gem could be helpful to generate activation codes easy for people to remember.

h2. Installing

<pre syntax="ruby">sudo gem install random_word_generator</pre>

h2. The basics

Generate a random word:
  RandomWordGenerator.word
  
Generate a random word of a specific length:
  RandomWordGenerator.of_length(15)

Generate a string composed of random words where the sum of the length of the words is equal to a specific value:
  RandomWordGenerator.composed(2, 15)

h2. Demonstration of usage

require 'random_word_generator'
=> true

RandomWordGenerator.word
=> "woozily"

RandomWordGenerator.word
=> "reviewable"

RandomWordGenerator.of_length(15)
=> "unseaworthiness"

RandomWordGenerator.of_length(15)
=> "downheartedness"

RandomWordGenerator.of_length(7)
=> "whooper"

RandomWordGenerator.composed(2, 15)
=> "yows woodcarver"

RandomWordGenerator.composed(2, 15)
=> "swamplands thew"

RandomWordGenerator.composed(2, 20, '-')
=> "enamelware-whitehead"

RandomWordGenerator.composed(3, 27, '|')
=> "floorwalker|yows|forwarders"
