# Abrakadabra

This is an implementation of the game "Wordle". The rules are the same: you have to guess the word by entering words that might fit using the game's hints. Green color means that the letter is there and is in its place. Orange color means that the letter is there, but it is not in its place. gray color means that there is no such letter in the hidden word. The game ends if you guessed the word or if you run out of attempts

## Running the repl

Simply hit run! You can edit the run command from the `.replit` file.

## Installing packages

To add packages to your repl, we recommend using the Replit packager interface in the left sidebar or using `bundle install` in the shell. Check out the [Bundle docs here](https://bundler.io/guides/getting_started.html).

**Warning: Avoid using `gem install` to add packages.**

Beacuse Ruby repls use [Bundle](https://bundler.io/) under the hood to provide a consistent environment that tracks and installs the exact gems and versions needed, we recommend using `bundle install` instead of `gem install`, which may not work as expected.

## Authors
Abrakadabra was created by a team of Ruby developers: Kalashnikova Arina, Prikhod'ko Alexey, Staren'kaya Anastasia, Tsaturyan Maria.
