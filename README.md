# Abrakadabra


This is an implementation of the game "Wordle". The rules are the same: you have to guess the word by entering words that might fit using the game's hints. Green color means that the letter is there and is in its place. Orange color means that the letter is there, but it is not in its place. Gray color means that there is no such letter in the hidden word. The game ends if you guessed the word or if you run out of attempts

## Usage

require 'abrakadabra'
